# x86_64 Assembly Studies

This repository contains my personal studies with **x86_64 assembly**.

The main goal is to deeply understand **low-level programming**, focusing on how software really works at the machine level.

## Objectives

- Learn x86_64 assembly on Linux
- Understand memory, registers, stack, and calling conventions
- Study addressing modes and relocations 
- Improve skills for:
  - Reverse engineering
  - Binary exploitation
  - Malware analysis
  - Operating system internals

## Environment

- Architecture: x86_64
- OS: Linux
- Assembler: NASM
- Debugger: GDB

## Notes

This repository is for **educational purposes only**.  
All code here was written as part of my learning process and may contain experiments, mistakes, and incremental improvements.
